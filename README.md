# Winner
Guess the winner button (3 buttons)
In the HTML, I created three buttons with a div where they are framed.
In CSS, I set the style of the buttons and added a style for the winning button (ID #winner).
In JavaScript, I chose a number between 1 and 3 to determine the winning button and added a click event for each button. If the button clicked is the winning button, then a "You won!" message will be displayed. and change the ID of the button to change its style (using #winner in the CSS). Otherwise, a "You lost!" message will be displayed.
